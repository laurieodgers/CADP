cadp - cloud agnostic deployment platform (for lack of a better name)

Brainstorming here:

objective: a cloud agnostic deployment program 
- terraform and opentf sucks. shitty notation, now commercial licence and a messy fight between the two
- terraform/opentf require different manifests/objects for deployment to different cloud providers - this is the problem to solve
- replace with yaml
- terraform requires a statefile which we hope to eliminate
- must have: ability to deploy to any cloud provider using the same manifest
   - via plugins

specifics:
- each vm or item is controlled by an id which is provided by the user. applied to vm and boot disk via tags, maybe everything else associated
- no statefile, its all controlled by the id mentioned above
- where its deployed to is via command line. eg cadp deploy -i filename --destination (gcp, aws, azure, do, etc) --serviceaccount (path-to-file)
- no statefile means that any version of cadp should be able to be applied to the same infrastructure


optional which will be implemented in future:
- k8s integration

First steps:
- implement ability to deploy a vm into gcp/aws/azure

Potential names:
- mustr (vms are cattle, we are mustering them)
- drovr - keeping with the cattle theme
